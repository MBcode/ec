## This is an [EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/) [GeoCODES](https://www.earthcube.org/geocodes) staging ground

Just starting to [edit](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/edit/gh-pages/index.md) the Markdown files.

The early doc started with the main [ReadMe](https://github.com/MBcode/ec#readme) &then topical sub-dirs

The latest thoughts on the most genericaly useful, but waylaid work is [here](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/tree/master/crawl#readme)

One of the most lasting effects on the community is the use of [ScieneOnSchema.org](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/GETTING-STARTED.md) metadata

Yet that often ends in text/**string** vs interconnected graph URI/**thing** descriptions

I want to start deduplicating, and giving URI IDs,& then using NER for annotation, to get a healthy graph of connections

By using even more [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) we can improve the machine actionalble aids to doing science
