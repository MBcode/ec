** search a [[https://clowderframework.org/][clowder]] store
*** started with:
run.sh ss.py search-shim, so can qry.py and now r2.sh to start ss2sq.py which also uses sq.py SPARQL text-search 
*** now generating html vs json
Now run.sh sc2.py which calls out to fillSearch.py, search.htm has 1st form call to this service, which regenerates the page w/serch results
*** upcoming/in-process
use the getjsonLD calls to get elts, to have a faceted/filtering search, maybe incl search-sub-topics from [[https://search.carrot2.org/#/search/web/site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroshare.org%20carbon/treemap][carrot2]] clustering[[https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/carrot2][(dcs)]]
*** main py call:
sc2.py calls fillSearch.py makes full html for search.htm
*** evolution of shared format, that can cluster
sq.py sparql -xml-> dcs ;
sq2.py clowder|sparql -xml-> dcs ;
csq2.py calls sq2.py+dcs -middle-htm ;
&now that is the 1st choice call from fillSearch.py
