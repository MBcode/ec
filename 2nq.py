#DF's gleaner uses the shah of the jsonld to name the .rdf files which are actually .nt files
# but then there are lots of .nq files that are actually .nt files, but should be able to get them w/this
#maybe someplace in nabu this is done, but by then I can't have the files to load them

#use filename to convert .rdf file to a .nq file
