~Glossary links:
I could take snippets from all these pages, but keeping it terse.
Should be enough to explain much of my 1st help page:
http://mbobak-ofc.ncsa.illinois.edu/about.htm  page w/diagram w/these links in it

https://stedolan.github.io/jq/      json minipulation, though extruct can go right to jsonLD if you don't mind skipping other formats
