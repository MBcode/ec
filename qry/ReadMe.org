*** triplestore only now:
qry2.py is a SPARQL centric version of ../search; Now split out to qry.py and b2c.py: bindings-to-clusters 
*** but can still use old templating:
The ../search/fillSearch.py can easily call this(instead of csq2.py)and get much faster results
*** Now using the js in fsearch.html
So do not have to use the py code now
