### Examples of science-on-schema.org/[DataRepository](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/DataRepository.md)

#### This is from a crawl of the top level URL for each of these repos

I used: pip3 install [extruct](https://pypi.org/project/extruct/)

then called extruct on each of the URLs

this pulls out the embedded json-ld, 

along with any other valid RDF embedded in those pages
