This data along with the results of the cyclic torsional shear tests conducted at Kyoto University for LEAP-Asia-2018, and the results of the monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests conducted at GWU for LEAP-2015 and LEAP-2017 are provided to the numerical simulation teams who participate in the LEAP-Asia-2018 and LEAP-RPI-2019 prediction exercises. The numerical simulation teams use these results to calibrate the constitutive models." , "Designsafe-CI" ,  , " Liquefaction Strength,  Stress-Strain Response, Cyclic Direct Simple Shear Test,  Ottawa F-65 Sand" , "2018-11-17T14:48:11.883-06:00" ,  ,
