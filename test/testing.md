# From [ingestTesting.md](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/blob/master/test/ingestTesting.md) sec2: on (CI) spot testing
### The .md version derived from [.ipynb](ingesttesting.ipynb) version, with a focus on documentation only, and adding diagrams

Here are the parts that the doc was broken into:

1) How the [counts](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/blob/master/test/counts.md) from the repo-sitemaps sometimes fall off in the LD-cache (jsonld&ntriples), then also not getting into the endpoint
2) Then from the original cut of spot testing, but [now just new code and img below](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/blob/master/test/testing.md)=this page, is getting a rewrite to just focus on that
3) How to best [sample](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/blob/master/test/sample.md) from the sitemaps, which has become a test set, w/the hash naming in ec/test/standard/ summoned&milled

### Sec2: CI spot testing.md

Everything below is done against a gold-standard to test the workflow, has the same function

Different checks will be used for production, where we only have expected [counts](counts.md)

## what gets passed into the Notebook
This should be read from/passed to the notebook. Suggest as a JSON structure. Needs to be short and Hashcoded url

Though would like it if gleaner/nabu could be run w/o having to touch so many places.

## Data Loading: 
### Run end to end, show missing, check in cache, then know count at every stage
Basic Data loading flight testing:
* Run end to end, sitemap to endpoint
    * Query endpoint to get graph/filename URN names that might be missing
    * Gives you counts for the last step, and an easier way to lookup middle steps
* Use URN for filename in LD-cache to check to see if missing there as well
    * Check LD-cache for both types of RDF: summoned jsonld and milled ntriples
    * Will give us both the counts for these stages, and any diffs, to help debug process
* Scoped software use / blame
    * Gleaner & 'nabu' to get  sitemap to 'endpoint', and be able to find if all the expected graphs made it
    * Testing is done with earthcube_utils, that check the endpoint graphs against the expected, and check cache for missing
    * If ntriples in cache, but not in endpoint, then blame 'nabu' for not syncing it
    * If the file for the URN is not in the LD-cache as .rdf, then blame nabu
    * If the file for the URN is not in the LD-cache as .jsonld, then blame gleaner

#### Scopes of workflow elements: Gleaner/nabu are the verbs transitioning the data-objects, that we can test for
We can always get the [counts.md](counts.md) fall off, but we can best tell if the intermediate data files are broken by diffs with expected results during workflow spot testing. Though with URN listing from each stage we could [better check them in prod](http://geocodes.ddns.net/ec/test/counts/bucket_files.py).

The Config for normal crawls and spot testing each have a sitemap

Only spot testing of the workflow has expected results

The spot testing comparisons give the change in counts when compared with expected

normal crawls with no expected results need to use the [counts.md](counts.md) utils

spot tests, can still run this counts checking code, even though the comparison w/test set will give it

## Crawl-workflow (gleaner/nabu) spot tests
* Run query on test-endpoint to get graph-URNs and other expected values
* Compare retrieved URNs with expected, then use missing-URNs to look them up in the LD-Cache
* Look up both RDF formats (jsonld and ntriples) and compare with gold standard, return any diffs

   end

   CLD --> LD_Cache
 ```
 * cmp_URNs gives count of (missing) in the last stage
   * retrieved_URNs - expected_URNs = missing_URNs
   * count(missing_URNs) = sitemap_count - count(retrieved_URNs) 
* use_missing that didn't make it into the graph to call cmp_LD to find out their state
* cmp_LD give count of (missing) from intermediate stages
   * Assume if made it into graph that cached LD was ok, but can still do [counts.md](counts.md)
   * If not in graph, either missing or broken, so determine this with cmp_LD routines
      * returns True for each format if ok
      * returns diff if differs, incl if missing or can just return 'missing'
   * LD_cache count = sitemap_count - count(missing_URNs) + count(cmp_LD say are ok)
      * so spot-testing can be a little more detailed with count of broken = count(cmp_LD say have diffs)

### Report
* EC-Testing report of what made it through the Gleaner then nabu stages
   * Report counts at each stage
   * For workflow spot-testing can report any diffs as well
      * Endpoint comparison can give more than URN diffs.  We can track any value changes as well
      * Any graph that changes, when found can be diff'd with it's gold-standard version. To report those changes
* Count/diffs given with view of the scope of the workflow software
   * count(LD_cache jsonld missing or broken) assigned to gleaner
   * count(LD_cache ntriples missing or broken) assigned to nabu, if gleaner had the jsonld
   * count(QUADs missing) assigned to nabu, if earlier stage was there
      * (sitemap_count == spot expected URN_count) - (count_graphs(endpoint) == count(spot URNs expected)) == missing graphs/URNs
      * Can always get count.md number, but can only get diffs of broken by comparing with spot test gold standard
* SCHACL Validation reports [(TBD)](repo-dashboard)

## Example of config spot-testing standards and comparisons
#### Got end-to-end expected [sparql](standard/qry1.txt)-to->[df](standard/queryResults1.csv)/[URNs](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/blob/master/test/standard/milled/geocodes_demo_datasets/URNs.txt), for 1st comparison below
next I use diff in df to find missing URNs, and look in LD-cache for them (bc of gleaner naming)
Check both jsonld and other rdf, with standard values
in [ingestTesting.md](https://github.com/MBcode/ec/blob/master/test/ingestTesting.md) sec 2, still have dictdiff and rdflib graph cmp
but now also have output from [blabel](https://github.com/aidhog/blabel/) that removes BlankNodes+some dups, for easier nt file comparison

### the expected_urls.csv or dataset_tests.csv will get finer grain, incl all the tests a dataset will go through
Right now I think most in standard will complete, but need to know which don't and why; will look at SR's look at this

We have a few test jsonld instances in 
[GeoCODES-Metadata](https://github.com/earthcube/GeoCODES-Metadatatree/main/metadata) that probably need their dataset_tests.csv to have finer grain expectations of the results of the tests; also to have the ability to have more than one test run; download, json conformance, and then to have some things that just go to a [repo-dashboard of warnings](repo-dashboard.md), like schema conformance.
 As long as it also tests well to turining into triples, and getting asserted in the triplestore, we should still do a text-bases search on it's strings.
 But even beyond conformance, the metadata has a way to go, to have better machine actionablitity.
