# Onboarding a new data repository
## decision-tree:

### Do you have a ROR or re3data or other organizational ID?
#### yes: please supply and we will parse it, then just ask for the fields it did not contain
#### no: please create one: two possible links to start with; as this ID can be reused much more easily than all the text

### likely- will need your repositories sitemap url
#### you can also provide a robots.txt to limit scraping of your metadata

### Do you provide dataset landing pages, with metadata as suggested in the ESIPFed Sci on schema.org site?
#### no: have links as a starting place to get you going with this
