The routine occurrence of 500-m diver during foraging trips to sea is both a physiological and behavior enigma. The objectives of this project address how and why emperors dive as deep and long as they do. The project examines four major topics in the diving biology of emperor penguins: pressure tolerance, oxygen store management, end-organ tolerance of diving hypoxemia/ischemia, and deep-dive foraging behavior. These subjects are relevant to the role of the emperor as a top predator in the Antarctic ecosystem, and to critical concepts in diving physiology, including decompression sickness, nitrogen narcosis, shallow water blackout, hypoxemic tolerance, and extension of aerobic dive time. The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) Prevention of nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness in emperor penguins is achieved by inhibition of pulmonary gas exchange at depth. 2) Shallow water black out does not occur because of greater cerebral hypoxemic tolerance, and, in deep dives, because of resumption of pulmonary gas exchange during final ascent. 3) The rate of depletion of the blood oxygen store is a function of depth of dive and heart rate. 4) The aerobic dive limit (ADL) reflects the onset of lactate accumulation in locomotory muscle, not total depletion of all oxygen stores. 5) Elevation of tissue antioxidant capacity and free-radical scavenging enzyme activities protect against the routine ischemia/reperfusion which occur during diving. 6) During deep dives, the Antarctic silverfish, Pleuorogramma antarcticum, is the primary prey item for emperors. In addition to evaluation of the hypotheses below, the project has broader impacts in several areas such as partnership with foreign and national institutes and organizations (e.g., the National Institute of Polar Research of Japan, Centro de Investigacioines del Noroeste of Mexico, National Geographic, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and Sea World). Participation in National Geographic television documentaries will provide unique educational opportunities for the general public; development of state-of-the-art technology (e.g., blood oxygen electrode recorders, blood samplers, and miniaturized digital cameras) will lay the groundwork for future research by this group and others; and the effects of the B15 iceberg on breeding success of emperor penguins will continue to be evaluated with population censuses during planned fieldwork at several Ross Sea emperor penguin colonies.'}}, {'s': {'type': 'uri', 'value': 'DOI:10.15784/600033'}, 'o': {'type': 'literal', 'value': \"Abstract: Denitrification is the main process by which fixed nitrogen is lost from ecosystems and the regulation of this process may directly affect primary production and carbon cycling over short and long time scales. Previous investigations of the role of bioactive metals in regulating denitrification in bacteria from permanently ice-covered Lake Bonney in the Taylor Valley of East Antarctica indicated that denitrifying bacteria can be negatively affected by metals such as copper, iron, cadmium, lead, chromium, nickel, silver and zinc; and that there is a distinct difference in denitrifying activity between the east and west lobes of the lake. Low iron concentrations were found to exacerbate the potential toxicity of the other metals, while silver has the potential to specifically inhibit denitrification because of its ability to interfere with copper binding in redox proteins, such as nitrite reductase and nitrous oxide reductase. High silver concentrations might prevent the functioning of nitrous oxide reductase in the same way that simple copper limitation does, thereby causing the buildup of nitrous oxide and resulting in a nonfunctional nitrogen cycle. Other factors, such as oxygen concentration, are likely also to affect bacterial activity in Lake Bonney. This project will investigate silver toxicity, general metal toxicity and oxygen concentration to determine their effect on denitrification in the lake by using a suite of 'sentinel' strains of denitrifying bacteria (isolated from the lake) incubated in Lake Bonney water and subjected to various treatments. The physiological responses of these strains to changes in metal and oxygen concentration will be quantified by flow cytometric detection of single cell molecular probes whose sensitivity and interpretation have been optimized for the sentinel strains. Understanding the relationships between metals and denitrification is expected to enhance our understanding of not only Lake Bonney's unusual nitrogen cycle, but more generally, of the potential role of metals in the regulation of microbial nitrogen transformations. The broader impacts of this work include not only a better understanding of regional biogeochemistry and global perspectives on these processes; but also the training of graduate students and a substantial outreach effort for school children.\"}}, {'s': {'type': 'uri', 'value': 'DOI:10.15784/600043'}, 'o': {'type': 'literal', 'value': 'Abstract: Phaeocystis Antarctica is a widely distributed phytoplankton that forms dense blooms and aggregates in the Southern Ocean. This phytoplankton and plays important roles in polar ecology and biogeochemistry, in part because it is a dominant primary producer, a main component of organic matter vertical fluxes, and the principal producer of volatile organic sulfur in the region. Yet P. Antarctica is also one of the lesser known species in terms of its physiology, life history and trophic relationships with other organisms; furthermore, information collected on other Phaeocystis species and from different locations may not be applicable to P. Antarctica in the Ross Sea. P. Antarctica occurs mainly as two morphotypes: solitary cells and mucilaginous colonies, which differ significantly in size, architecture and chemical composition. Relative dominance between solitary cells and colonies determines not only the size spectrum of the population, but also its carbon dynamics, nutrient uptake and utilization. Conventional thinking of the planktonic trophic processes is also challenged by the fact that colony formation could effectively alter the predator-prey interactions and interspecific competition. However, the factors that regulate the differences between solitary and colonial forms of P. Antarctica are not well-understood. The research objective of this proposal is therefore to address these over-arching questions: 1. Do P. Antarctica solitary cells and colonies differ in growth, composition and photosynthetic rates? 2. How do nutrients and grazers affect colony development and size distribution of P. Antarctica? 3. How do nutrients and grazers act synergistically to affect the long-term population dynamics of P. Antarctica? Experiments will be conducted in the McMurdo station with natural P. Antarctica assemblages and co-occurring grazers. Laboratory experiments will be conducted to study size-specific growth and photosynthetic rates of P. Antarctica, size-specific grazing mortality due to microzooplankton and mesozooplankton, the effects of macronutrients on the (nitrogen compounds) relative dominance of solitary cells and colonies, and the effects of micronutrient (Fe) and grazing related chemical signals on P. Antarctica colony development. Because this species is of critical importance in the Southern Ocean, and because this research will provide critical information on factors that regulate the role of P.Antarctica in food webs and biogeochemical cycles, a major gap in knowledge will be addressed.

It is hypothesized that the mats are important sources of organic carbon and fixed nitrogen for the soil communities of the hyporheic zone, and release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) that serves the entire Dry Valley ecosystem. Field efforts will entail both observational and experimental components. Direct comparisons will be made between the mats and microbial populations underlying naturally rehydrated and desiccated mat areas, and between mat areas in the melt streams of the Adams and Miers Glaciers in Miers Valley. Both physiological and phylogenetic indices of the soil microbiota will be examined. Observations will include estimates of rates of mat carbon and nitrogen fixation, soil respiration and leucine and thymidine uptake (as measures of protein & DNA synthesis, respectively) by soil bacteria, bacterial densities and their molecular ecology. Experimental manipulations will include experimental re-wetting of soils and observations of the time course of response of the microbial community.

Ammonia oxidation and the overall process of nitrification-denitrification have received relatively little attention in polar oceans where the effects of climate change on biogeochemical rates are likely to be pronounced. Previous work on Ammonia Oxidizing Archaea (AOA) in the Palmer LTER study area West of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), has suggested strong vertical segregation of crenarchaeote metabolism, with the 'winter water' (WW, ~50-100 m depth range) dominated by non-AOA crenarchaeotes, while Crenarchaeota populations in the 'circumpolar deep water' (CDW), which lies immediately below the winter water (150-3500 m), are dominated by AOA. Analysis of a limited number of samples from the Arctic Ocean did not reveal a comparable vertical segregation of AOA, and suggested that AOA and Crenarchaeota abundance is much lower there than in the Antarctic. These findings led to 3 hypotheses that will be tested in this project: 1) the apparent low abundance of Crenarchaeota and AOA in Arctic Ocean samples may be due to spatial or temporal variability in populations; 2) the WW population of Crenarchaeota in the WAP is dominated by a heterotroph; 3) the WW population of Crenarchaeota in the WAP 'grows in' during spring and summer after this water mass forms. The study will contribute substantially to understanding an important aspect of the nitrogen cycle in the Palmer LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) study area by providing insights into the ecology and physiology of AOA. The natural segregation of crenarchaeote phenotypes in waters of the WAP, coupled with metagenomic studies in progress in the same area by others (A. Murray, H. Ducklow), offers the possibility of major breakthroughs in understanding of the metabolic capabilities of these organisms. This knowledge is needed to model how water column nitrification will respond to changes in polar ecosystems accompanying global climate change. The Principal Investigator will participate fully in the education and outreach efforts of the Palmer LTER, including making highlights of our findings available for posting to their project web site and participating in outreach (for example, Schoolyard LTER).

This chronology is derived by orbitally tuning to molecular oxygen to nitrogen (O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) ratios in occluded air for depths deeper than 1550 m (greater than 112,000 years old), and by gas correlation to the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) chronology for the ice core section that is shallower than 1422 m (less than 102,000 years old). Because of poor gas preservation in air bubbles in shallower depths, investigators could only constrain the Vostok chronology for the section deeper than 1550 m by O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Thus for the shallower section of the core, they synchronized the Vostok delta oxygen-18 (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) measurements to those of the GISP2 to obtain the chronology (see Bender, et al. 2006). Note, CH<sub>4</sub> data are not included in this data set.
